    # the IP address for the Result Server as your machine sees it. If you don't specify an
    # address here, the machine will use the default value from cuckoo.conf.
    # NOTE: if you set this option you have to set result server IP to 0.0.0.0 in cuckoo.conf.
    # Example:
    resultserver_ip: 192.168.56.1

    # (Optional) Specify the port for the Result Server, as your virtual machine sees it.
